## Project Title:
Posit - Index-based computation of real-number multiplication with SiliconCompiler

## Project Description:
We propose to design and implement a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operation where the
activation inputs are in 16-bit IEEE floating-point format (FP16), and the weights are in 4-
bit posit (Posit4) format with SiliconCompiler. SiliconCompiler is an open-source framework
that automates the translation from source code to silicon. We aim to use SiliconCompiler
to compile the Verilog RTL design of FP16-Posit4 MAC to a GDS file.
